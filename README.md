This Microsoft Access database is designed for a fictional gym, Peak Performance Fitness, to manage daily operations efficiently.
It stores and organizes key business data including members, employees, equipment loans, reviews, timesheets, and class schedules.
The database also includes SQL queries, forms, and reports to streamline management tasks such as tracking attendance, managing equipment, and analyzing membership trends.

Main Features

Member Management:
Store and manage details about gym members including customer id, billing adddress, contact information, membership type, start date, and expiration date.

Employee Management:
Maintain employee records such as salaries, hire date and end date.

Equipment Loans:
Track which equipment items are loaned out, who borrowed them, and when they are due for return.

Class Schedules:
Manage gym classes, including class name, instructor, and schedule.

Developer’s Note

I continue to improve this database in my free time, applying new techniques and insights I’ve gained through ongoing learning and hands-on experience.
Each update is aimed at making the project more efficient, user-friendly, and reflective of real-world database design practices.
